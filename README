The Next Generation Embryology Project aims to develop a web application
which provides annotations over 3D rendering of embryos.

This project was funded by JISC (http://www.jisc.ac.uk/) to develop a
prototype system. The project was funded for 18 months. Design began in
September 2009, and active development started in January 2010. The project
has now concluded, and as of 1 October, development has now ceased.

Future plans
------------
I do not plan to work on the project in the near future, as I am involved
with other things; however, I plan to come back at some point. Because the
system was designed using requirements, which changed as the project
progressed, the design is not solid. There are several parts which can be
re-factored and improved.
